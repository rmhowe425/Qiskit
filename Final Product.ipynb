    "In general terms, let $G$ be a group, let $a$ be an element of $G$ of order $r$, and let $b$ be some power of $a$, so that $b = a^m$, for $0 \\leq m < r$. The discrete logarithm problem is as follows: given $a$ and $b$, find the integer $m$. While $b$ may be easy to calculate given $a$ and $m$, there is no known efficient classical algorithm for finding $m$ given $a$ and $b$. This fact is the basis of many modern cryptosystems. In this project, we present a novel method for solving the discrete logarithm problem."

    "The *half-bit* of $b$, denoted $HB_a(b)$, is defined as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ HB_a(b) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "0 & 0 \\leq m < r/2 \\\\\n",
    "1 & r/2 \\leq m < r\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the half-bit of $b$ has a natural interpretation as the most significant bit of the binary expansion of $m$. In his 1988 thesis, Burton S. Kaliski Jr. proves that, given an oracle that is able to correctly predict the half-bit with probability at least $1/2 + \\epsilon$, the discrete logarithm problem can be solved in polynomial time, by making several oracle queries on values closely related to $b$. Kaliski also presents the algorithm to solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2017, Kaliski published a paper describing a quantum circuit to efficiently implement this oracle, which he calls a quantum \"magic box.\" While Shor's algorithm depends on solving the entire discrete logarithm problem using one quantum circuit, implementing this oracle would only require the quantum processor to calculate one bit of the discrete logarithm at a time, potentially saving valuable computational resources."

    "* `create_controlled_unitary(a, N)`: similar to `create_unitary`, but returns a matrix which performs $U_{a^x}$ controlled by the first qubit.\n",

    "## Inefficiencies in the quantum oracle\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this algorithm is incredibly inefficient. There are a few reasons why this is the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum oracle is structured in two phases. The first phase operates on two quantum registers, and results in (a) the measured value of register 1, and (b) the superposition on register 2. The measured value is then used to construct the rest of the circuit for the second phase of the quantum algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, Qiskit as yet does not have a way to access the value in a classical register mid-circuit. Therefore, our algorithm has no way to know what value was measured in the first phase. Our stopgap solution is to build every possible circuit that could result from the first phase, and only execute them if the classical register is in a particular state. This starts on the line `for y in range(2**n)`, which is clearly exponential in the input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, Kaliski's 2017 paper relies heavily on the unitary transformations $U_{a^x}$, as defined above. However, we were unable to find an efficient way to build these unitary transformations. The current solution is to build them as needed, although the matrices used to represent these transformations have size exponential in the number of qubits used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discrete logarithm algorithm is directly from Kaliski's 1988 thesis, and is provably fast. Specifically, it requires $O\\left(\\log^{5/2}\\left(n/\\epsilon^3\\right)\\right)$ modular multiplications, and $O\\left(\\log^{3/2}\\left(n/\\epsilon^2\\right)\\right)$ calls to the oracle. Given the inefficiencies in the quantum oracle, this results in a significant speed disadvantage."

    "## Future work\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, much is to be done on this project. Most pressingly, we would like to find an efficient implementation of the unitaries $U_{a^x}$ that the oracle algorithm depends on. In addition, a large amount of inefficiency comes from our implementation of the second phase of the quantum algorithm. While the best solution to this problem is additional functionality in Qiskit and quantum hardware, we could find other workarounds. For example, the `QuantumCircuit.snapshot()` method could greatly increase our efficiency. And because our algorithm only runs on simulators for now, this could be a near-term solution. In addition, Kaliski's 2017 paper describes a number of potential improvements to the quantum oracle, any one of which has the potential to improve its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we would like to build off the algorithm presented here in the future. This is a raw mathematical model for solving the discrete logarithm problem, but this has many practical applications, most notably in the field of cryptography. In an attempt to make quantum algorithms more accessible, we would like to expand this notebook to explain in detail Kaliski's algorithm, and present a basic example of this technique being used to break RSA encryption. (Of course, the keys would likely be on the order of 3-4 bits!)"
